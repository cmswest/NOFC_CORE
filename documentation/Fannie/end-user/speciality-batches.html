<i>This is more of a state of tools report than proper end-user
documentation at this point</i>.
<h2>Co+op Deals</h2>
This ought to work most places. The first option, 
<i>Upload Price File</i>, just takes a co-op deals flyer saved as
a CSV. The biggest question here is whether what my merch manager
gives me is the same as what other stores receive. The other
minor gotcha is lately they've been putting newlines in the
header row which kicks out an ugly CSV (at least in OpenOffice).
Deleting the multiline headers before export fixes that.
<p />
The other option, <i>Review &amp; create</i> lists Co+op Deals
items that exist in POS and has fields for start/end dates to
generate batches containing all the appropriate items. The main
snag is this depends on super departments. Creating a single
super department that encompasses all departments would be
sufficient to make this work (producing one big Deals batch).
<h2>Vendor Pricing</h2>
This one takes a vendor pricing CSV and updates item costs. The
biggest question is again how standardized are each vendor's files?
Do my UNFI sheets have the same layout as everyone else's?
<p />
The other snag is just the degree of prep work. SRPs are calculated
based on the desired margins for departments, so you need the whole
department scheme figured out and have all the item &amp; margin
assignments done. Super departments tie in again with managing
vendor-specific price change batches, but the "All" options do
provide an alternative.
